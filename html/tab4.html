    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.KWH graph, November to March and graph of residents and KWH consumed by my colleagues.
     
    </p>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li> There is a negative correlation and there is a decay as the months go by, for example when the amount of Kwh increases the regression decreases with respect to the months. </li>
            <li> Months 1 and 2 show higher numbers of kwh (greater than 190), while in months 3, 4 and 5 the numbers are lower (kwh less than 160).</li>
            <li>According to the equation that allows us to know what will be the
              approximate consumption of the next month which is: -13.50*6+209.70 this is
              equal to: 128.7 (consumption for month 6(approx)) $$ y = -13.50 \cdot 6 +
              209.70 $$ $$ y = 128.7 $$</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I find a not very strong relationship between the Kwh variables and the months, since there is a very wide spectrum (especially between the Kwh variable from 140 to 200) that does not allow to be so precise when making the predictions and the linear regression is relatively far from the points.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the data collected from the plot, an analysis of the graph is made.
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>It is evident that the linear regression is exponential and increasing; the fewer the number of residents, the lower the energy expenditure in kWh and the more residents the energy expenditure in kWh increases in an increasing way. </li>
         <li> The lowest point is when the residents variable is 2 and the value in kWh is around 100 and when there are 7 residents the energy expenditure is around 500 kWh, in comparison the regression increases and it can be seen how it grows as the number of residents is higher (3, 4 and 5 residents). </li>
         <li>The energy expended by a group of 200 people according to my data is $$ y = 51.40 \cdot 200 +
          10.17 $$ $$ y = 10,290.17 $$</li>
         <li>Compared to graph 1, in this graph the kwh and resident data is not so far from the linear regression and is a little more in line with the spectrum in which the different variables are found.</li>
      </ul>
