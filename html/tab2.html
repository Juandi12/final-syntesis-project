<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. KWH graph, November
  to March and graph of residents and KWH consumed by my colleagues.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot,the graphic displays that
  behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The regression decreased as the true consumption of my household has been
    decreasing month by month, except in the month of February, when the true
    consumption would have a slight increase. Speaking of the regression line
    itself and taking into account that it fits a line that is close to all the
    points, the electricity consumption has decreased.
  </li>
  <li>
    The blue dot shows the real energy consumption of my home in KWH. The gray
    dot shows the regression line of my home's energy consumption. These are
    related in that the gray dots attempt to form a line that accounts for, so
    to speak, an average of the true consumption, the regression line is drawn
    by trying to pass through all the red dots of the true energy consumption.
  </li>
  <li>
    According to the equation that allows us to know what will be the
    approximate consumption of the next month which is: -13.10*6+331.30 this is
    equal to: 252.7 (consumption for month 6(approx)) $$ y = -13.10 \cdot 6 +
    331.30 $$ $$ y = 257.7 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In conclusion, I find a relationship between the points or variables, since
    the graph shows us different results, a more specific sample that are the
    blue points and the gray points we find a general average of consumption, it
    gives us information, saying that there was an average or a trend of
    increase.
    <br />
    <br />
    Energy consumption can be kept stable by reducing unnecessary energy
    consumption and by using daylight, for example.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the data collected from the plot, an analysis of the graph is
  made.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    According to the graph the regression line increases, since in this case the
    highest energy consumption is in the highest number of people residing in a
    dwelling.
  </li>
  <li>
    According to the graph, the blue dots show the amount of actual consumption
    as a function of residents and the gray dots make an overall average of
    actual consumption (blue dots).
  </li>
  <li>
    The energy expended by a group of 200 people according to my data is: $$ y =
    50.81 \cdot 200 + (-12.82) $$ $$ y = 10,149.18 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    I can conclude, based on the graph and on a general average, that the more
    residents the more energy consumption. It can be specifically concluded that
    for example in a 2-person house the highest consumption is 137 kWh, but in a
    4-person house the highest consumption is 110 kWh, this is due to two
    fundamental reasons.
    <br />
    <br />
    - Not all people spend equally.
    <br />
    <br />
    - In the case of consumption, the tax off depends on the stratum of the
    residential area.
  </li>
</ul>
