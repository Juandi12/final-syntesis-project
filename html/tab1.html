<h5>Electric energy</h5>
<p>
  Electrical energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
  kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the
  energy that has been converted from electric potential energy Electricity has
  two primary attributes: voltage and current. Voltage and current are separate
  properties, but are interrelated in electronic circuits. Both must be present
  for proper circuit operation.

<h5>Watt (physical energy)</h5>
<p>
  The watt (abbreviated w) is the International system of Units' (SI) standart
  unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one joule per second.
  <br />
  <br />
  The watt is used to specify the rate at wich electrical energy indissipated,
  or the rate at wich electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or
  dissipated.

<h5>Scatter plot</h5>
<p>
  A graph in which each mark represents a pair of values relating two sets of
  data (= numbers) drawn on a coordinate plane (= area with vertical and
  horizontal measures) Scatter plots visualize the relationship between two
  numeric variables, with one variable shown on the x-axis and the other on the
  y-axis. For each record, a point is plotted where the two variables intersect
  on the graph. When the points turn out to form a nonrandom structure, a
  relationship exists between the two variables.

<h5>Linear regression</h5>
<p>
  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on
  the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the
  dependent variable.
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />Properties of Linear Regression <br />
  <br />
  -The regression line passes through the mean of X and Y variable values <br />
  -The line reduces the sum of squared differences between observed values and
  predicted values.
  <br />
  -The regression constant (b0) is equal to y-intercept the linear regression.

<h5>Renewable energy</h5>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy produced from sources like the sun and wind that
  are naturally replenished and do not run out. Renewable energy can be used for
  electricity generation, space and water heating and cooling, and
  transportation.
  <br />
  <br />

  They are characterized by not using fossil fuels -as is the case with
  conventional energies-, but rather resources capable of unlimited renewal. Its
  environmental impact is of lesser magnitude given that in addition to not
  using finite resources, it does not generate pollutants.
