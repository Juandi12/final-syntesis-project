<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. KWH graph, November
  to March and graph of residents and KWH consumed by my colleagues.
</p>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the graph we can see that the linear regression is a little stable
    although it has a slight increase and in month 3 is where the highest amount
    of KWH is evidenced
  </li>
  <li>
    We can see that most of the points in the graph are scattered and are not
    stable, except for months 4 and 5, which are stable, while months 1, 2 and 3
    are on the rise.
  </li>
  <li>
    According to the equation that allows us to know what will be the
    approximate consumption of the next month which is: 1.70*6+156.30 this is
    equal to: 166.5 (consumption for month 6(approx)) $$ y = 1.70 \cdot 6 +
    156.30 $$ $$ y = 166.5 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    One conclusion that can be drawn is that in the first three months
    consumption had a notable and very upward increase, unlike in months 4 and
    5, which were somewhat stable, and thus should be maintained or decreased.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the data collected from the plot, an analysis of the graph is
  made.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It can be seen from the graph that the linear regression is increasing as
    the months go by and starts at 100 KWH and ends at approximately 280 KWH
  </li>
  <li>
    It can be observed that some points in the graph are similar as when there
    are 2 residents and they have almost the same consumption but it cannot be
    said that the more people the higher the consumption because with 4
    residents they have a low consumption and the highest figure is with 7
    people living in the same household with an amount of 480 KWH approximately.
  </li>
  <li>
    The energy expended by a group of 200 people according to my data is: $$ y =
    26.14 \cdot 200 + 59.49 $$ $$ y = 5,287.49 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    it can be concluded that the greater the number of residents the greater the
    consumption, since it can be seen that in some cases consumption is lower
    with a greater number of people, and this relationship helps us to make it
    clear that in some homes with a large number of people consumption is low
    and in others with few residents consumption is much higher.
  </li>
</ul>
