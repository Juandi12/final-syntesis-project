  In this part we are going to define some concepts consulted by the group, in
  order to deepen our project.

<h5>Electric energy</h5>
<p>
  Electrical energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
  kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the
  energy that has been converted from electric potential energy Electricity has
  two primary attributes: voltage and current. Voltage and current are separate
  properties, but are interrelated in electronic circuits. Both must be present
  for proper circuit operation.

<h5>Watt (physical energy)</h5>

<h5>Scatter plot</h5>
<p>
  A graph in which each mark represents a pair of values relating two sets of
  data (= numbers) drawn on a coordinate plane (= area with vertical and
  horizontal measures) Scatter plots visualize the relationship between two
  numeric variables, with one variable shown on the x-axis and the other on the
  y-axis. For each record, a point is plotted where the two variables intersect
  on the graph. When the points turn out to form a nonrandom structure, a
  relationship exists between the two variables.
